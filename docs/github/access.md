## Repository Permissions

As a member, you can be given various levels of access to repositories. Your permissions determine what you can do within each repository.

### Public vs. Private Repositories

- **Public Repositories** are visible to everyone and anyone can contribute. Ideal for open-source projects.
- **Private Repositories** are only visible to the project team and selected collaborators.
