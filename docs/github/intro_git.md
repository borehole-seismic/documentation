# Introduction to GitHub

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It allows multiple people to work together on projects from anywhere in the world. GitHub hosts your source code projects in a variety of programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration.

## Advantages of GitHub

- **Collaboration:** GitHub makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same project.
- **Version Control:** Keep track of and manage changes to projects over time.
- **Code Security:** With private repositories, your code is secured and accessible only to team members.
- **Branching:** Developers can work on different features or fixes without affecting the main project through branching.
- **Pull Requests:** Facilitate discussion about code changes before integrating them into the main branch.
- **Continuous Integration:** Automate the process of testing code in real-time, ensuring that changes pass tests before they are merged.
