# Picking Tool Overview

The Picking Tool is a sophisticated software solution tailored for the efficient identification of seismic waves in the field of oil and gas exploration. This comprehensive tool is designed to streamline the process of distinguishing between P-Waves (Primary or Compressional) and S-Waves (Secondary or Shear) in seismic data.


## Key Features

### 1. Wave Identification

The Picking Tool excels in the precise identification of seismic waves. It provides an intuitive interface for users to analyze and mark P-Waves, S-Waves and SS-waves in seismic data, enhancing the accuracy of data interpretation.

### 2. User Authentication and Project Management

With a robust user authentication system, the tool ensures secure access to authorized personnel. Users can seamlessly manage projects, allowing for organized and efficient data analysis.

### 3. Component Visualization

Utilizing a three-component geophone system, the tool visualizes seismic data in three colors: red, gray, and blue. These colors correspond to horizontal and vertical components, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the data.


## Getting Started

To begin using the Picking Tool, refer to the [Installation Guide](installation.md) for step-by-step instructions on setting up the tool on both Mac and Windows platforms.
