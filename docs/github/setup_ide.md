# Setting Up Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## Introduction to Visual Studio Code (VSCode)?

Visual Studio Code is a powerful, open-source Integrated Development Environment developed by Microsoft. It supports a wide range of programming languages and comes with features like syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and integrated Git. Developers use it to write, edit, and debug code.

## Why Use VSCode?

- **Multi-Language Support:** VSCode supports development in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, C++, Java, and many more languages.
- **Extensions:** Customize and enhance your coding experience with extensions for themes, languages, debuggers, and more.
- **Integrated Terminal:** Run shell commands, Git operations, and scripts directly within the editor.
- **Version Control:** Integrated Git support allows you to commit, pull, and push changes to and from your repositories without leaving the editor.
- **Debugging:** Built-in debugging tools for a variety of languages and frameworks.
