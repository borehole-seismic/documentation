# Frac Tab

## Overview
The Frac Tab is designed for monitoring and analyzing fracturing operations, offering real-time access to pump data and advanced plotting capabilities.

## Accessing and Utilizing Frac Data
- **Plotting Data**: The Frac Tab displays pump data plots as they become available in real-time. 
- **Mode Selection**: Choose between 'Per Stage' or 'Frac Design' for plotting. The latter option allows plotting of specific frac designs in a composite plot, color-coded by event density.
- **Additional Filters**: When selecting 'Frac Design', additional dropdown menus appear so you can create the composite or Elapsed RT.

    - On the Elapsed RT new menu, "Select Frac Group" is the Frac Design used. On Frac well menu, 
      select the well that you would like to plot (this only plots charts per well). Select Base Stage to select the best curve of the group that represents the treatment.

- **Dataset Selection**: Event dataset (3) could be real-time, post-processing master or post-processing representative dataset. 
Select the result that you would like to display. During real-time acquisition, you will only be able to display
real-time dataset.

- **Display Attributes**: Options include displaying magnitude or beach balls for events when Moment Tensor Inversion (MTI) is calculated. Note that MTI is available for post-processing for those projects that have included this analysis.

- **Generating Plots**: Marked by the number (5), after you have made your selections hit “Plot” to display below the chart. The “Download RTs” will download all the available figures which could be easily up to 100 figures. We strongly advise not to hit this button, unless if you would like to download all figures for the project.
Instead, it is advised to hit the camera button on top of the chart, indicated by the number (6). If you hover your mouse on top of the icons on the RT figure, an explanation of each button will appear.

## Plot Interaction and Customization
- **Zoom and Detail Viewing**: Zoom into specific time frames on the chart and view pump values for events or specific times. To zoom in, left click from left to right 
inside the plot. To zoom out, double-click inside the plot.

    -  If you hover the mouse on top of the events or curves in the chart, you will display the time and pump values for that event or in that specific time

- **Chart Personalization**: To personalize your RT chart, like the axis minimum and maximum values, click on Show/Hide Settings (7) to expand the menu. In the menu, you can select curves, adjust axis values by changing the numbers inside each property’s box, add and remove labels. After you updated the boxes, hit on the Update button. You can always update your selections and values on this menu and just hit “update” again to apply the new options.
