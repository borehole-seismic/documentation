# Trim Filter

The Trim Filter is essential, especially when dealing with merged files in seismic data analysis. This process ensures that merged files adhere to the standard time frame for consistent analysis.

## Using the Trim Function
1. **Context**: Often, merging two files leads to a doubled time range (e.g., from 1000ms to 2000ms). To revert it to the normal 1000ms, the trim function is used.
2. **Application**: Click the trim icon on the toolbar. In the trace view, a box appears for selection.

3. **Selection**: Select the portion of the data you wish to keep; the rest will be trimmed off, effectively shortening the file to your desired range.
