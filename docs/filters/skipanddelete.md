# Skip and Delete Functionality

In the workflow of seismic data analysis, not all files require picking. The Picking Tool offers options to streamline your process by skipping or deleting files.

## Skipping Files
- **How to Skip**: Right-click on a file in the navigation pane and select 'Skip'.

- **Handling Skipped Files**: There is no need to pick skipped files; they can be reviewed or processed later as needed.

## Deleting Files
- **How to Delete**: Right-click on a file and choose 'Delete'.
- **Deleted Files Folder**: Deleted files are placed into a 'Deleted Files' folder.
